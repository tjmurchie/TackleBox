# TackleBox

TackleBox is a collection of small, scriptable modules for reference construction,
mapping, metagenomic classification, and ancient DNA authenticity assessment.

Current modules:

- `flyguide/` – Build regional NCBI nucleotide reference panels from GBIF exports,
  with an optional NCBI “coverage check” (GuideCheck).

Planned modules:

- `spinner/` – Reference “spinner” for constructing and filtering regional
  reference FASTAs from larger databases.
- `flyforge/` – RNA bait design with customizable parameters for in-house capture enrichment.
- `fillet/` – BLAST/LAST/MEGAN/+/-based metagenomic classification pipeline.

Each module has its own README with usage and examples.
